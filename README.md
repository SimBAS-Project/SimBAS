# SimBAS

Here are the documents created for the public in the SimBAS project. The sources of the individual tools are also linked.

The complete documentation provides an overview of the individual tools in the toolchain and how they work in combination. 

The individual handouts use practical example applications to show how the toolchain can be used and what the individual tools contribute to the application analysis.
